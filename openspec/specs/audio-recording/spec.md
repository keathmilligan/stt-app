## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-whisper-stt-scaffolding. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Audio Device Enumeration
The system SHALL enumerate all available audio input devices and system audio sources, presenting them for user selection based on the selected source type.

#### Scenario: Devices listed on load
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** a dropdown displays all available audio input devices by name for the default source type (Input)

#### Scenario: No devices available
- **WHEN** no audio input devices are detected for the selected source type
- **THEN** the UI displays a message indicating no devices found and disables recording

#### Scenario: Source type change
- **WHEN** the user changes the source type
- **THEN** the device dropdown is repopulated with devices appropriate for the new source type

### Requirement: Audio Recording Control
The system SHALL allow the user to control audio capture through the Transcribe toggle. When Transcribe is active, audio capture runs continuously and speech segments are automatically extracted based on speech detection. Manual recording control is no longer supported.

#### Scenario: Start transcribe mode
- **WHEN** user enables the Transcribe toggle with a device selected
- **THEN** continuous audio capture begins and speech-triggered segment extraction becomes active

#### Scenario: Stop transcribe mode
- **WHEN** user disables the Transcribe toggle
- **THEN** any in-progress speech segment is finalized, audio capture stops, and the ring buffer is released

### Requirement: Audio Format Conversion
The system SHALL convert recorded audio to 16kHz mono format for Whisper compatibility.

#### Scenario: High sample rate input
- **WHEN** the input device provides audio at a sample rate other than 16kHz
- **THEN** the audio is resampled to 16kHz before transcription

#### Scenario: Stereo input
- **WHEN** the input device provides stereo audio
- **THEN** the audio is converted to mono before transcription

### Requirement: Audio Source Type Selection
The system SHALL allow users to select the audio source type: input device (microphone), system audio (desktop output), or mixed (both combined).

- **THEN** audio capture combines the primary and secondary sources as per existing Mixed Audio Capture behavior

#### Scenario: Echo Cancel mode selected
- **WHEN** the user selects "Echo Cancel" recording mode with both primary and secondary sources active
- **THEN** the system uses the secondary source as an AEC reference signal and outputs only the echo-cancelled primary source

#### Scenario: Echo Cancel mode with single source
- **WHEN** the user attempts to select "Echo Cancel" mode with only one source active
- **THEN** the UI prevents selection or indicates that two sources are required for this mode

#### Scenario: Echo Cancel mode produces voice-only output

#### Scenario: Split segment continues speech state
- **WHEN** a segment is split due to buffer overflow
- **THEN** the system remains in speech state, ready to extract the continuation when speech ends or another overflow occurs

### Requirement: Speech Segment Recording
The system SHALL capture speech segments as independent audio recordings, with each segment starting from the lookback-determined speech start point. Segment boundaries are determined by speech detection events within the continuous audio stream.

#### Scenario: Segment includes lookback audio

- **THEN** the audio is saved to a WAV file in the configured recordings directory with a timestamped filename

#### Scenario: Long speech produces multiple segments
- **WHEN** continuous speech exceeds the ring buffer capacity
- **THEN** the speech is split into multiple segments, each saved as a separate WAV file and queued for transcription independently

### Requirement: ScreenCaptureKit Permission Handling
The system SHALL handle ScreenCaptureKit permission requirements on macOS gracefully, providing clear feedback to users when permission is needed or denied.

#### Scenario: Permission check before system audio capture
