#### Scenario: Non-version tag ignored
- **WHEN** a tag not matching `v*.*.*` is pushed
- **THEN** the release workflow does not execute

### Requirement: Version Validation
The release workflow SHALL validate that the new version is greater than the latest release.

#### Scenario: Valid version increment
- **WHEN** the tag version is greater than the latest release
- **THEN** the workflow proceeds with the build

#### Scenario: Invalid version increment
- **WHEN** the tag version is not greater than the latest release
- **THEN** the workflow fails with a version error

#### Scenario: First release
- **WHEN** no previous releases exist
- **THEN** version validation passes without comparison

### Requirement: Release Artifact Building
The release workflow SHALL build release artifacts for all platforms.

#### Scenario: Linux release build
