## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Speech Detection Events
The system SHALL emit events when speech activity transitions occur, indicating when the user starts and stops speaking. Speech detection SHALL use multi-feature analysis including amplitude, zero-crossing rate, and spectral characteristics to distinguish speech from non-speech audio. The detector SHALL support both voiced and whispered speech through dual-mode detection.

#### Scenario: Voiced speech starts
- **WHEN** audio meets voiced speech criteria (amplitude > -40dB, ZCR 0.01-0.20, spectral centroid 250-4000 Hz) for the configured onset time (100ms)
- **THEN** the system emits a `speech-started` event to the frontend

#### Scenario: Whispered speech starts
- **WHEN** audio meets whisper speech criteria (amplitude > -50dB, ZCR 0.10-0.40, spectral centroid 400-6000 Hz) for the whisper onset time (150ms)
- **THEN** the system emits a `speech-started` event to the frontend

#### Scenario: Speech ends after hold time
- **WHEN** audio amplitude falls below the detection threshold and remains below for the configured hold time (default 300ms)
- **THEN** the system emits a `speech-ended` event to the frontend

#### Scenario: Brief pause during speech
- **WHEN** audio amplitude briefly falls below threshold but returns above threshold before hold time elapses
- **THEN** no `speech-ended` event is emitted (debouncing prevents false triggers)

#### Scenario: Processing disabled
- **WHEN** voice processing is disabled via toggle
- **THEN** no speech detection events are emitted

#### Scenario: Keyboard click rejected
- **WHEN** a brief impulsive sound like a keyboard click produces high amplitude with ZCR > 0.40 and spectral centroid > 5500 Hz
- **THEN** the transient is rejected and no speech-started event is emitted

#### Scenario: Low rumble rejected
- **WHEN** low-frequency ambient noise produces amplitude above threshold but spectral centroid below 250 Hz
- **THEN** the sound is rejected as non-speech

#### Scenario: Soft whispered speech detected
- **WHEN** the user speaks softly or whispers with amplitude between -50dB and -40dB
- **THEN** the whisper detection mode captures the speech after the whisper onset time

### Requirement: Configurable Speech Detection Parameters
The system SHALL allow configuration of speech detection sensitivity through threshold, hold time, and feature range parameters.

#### Scenario: Default parameters
- **WHEN** the speech detector is created without explicit configuration
- **THEN** it uses default voiced threshold (-40dB), whisper threshold (-50dB), hold time (300ms), voiced onset time (100ms), and whisper onset time (150ms)

#### Scenario: Custom threshold
- **WHEN** a custom threshold is configured
- **THEN** speech detection uses the specified threshold for amplitude comparison

#### Scenario: Dual-mode validation
- **WHEN** audio is analyzed for speech detection
- **THEN** features are validated against both voiced and whisper mode criteria

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Zero-Crossing Rate Analysis
The system SHALL compute the zero-crossing rate of audio samples to distinguish voiced speech from impulsive transient sounds and to identify whispered speech characteristics.

#### Scenario: ZCR calculation
- **WHEN** an audio buffer is processed
- **THEN** the system calculates the normalized zero-crossing rate (crossings per sample)

#### Scenario: Voiced speech ZCR
- **WHEN** the ZCR falls within the voiced speech range (0.01-0.20)
- **THEN** the sample passes the ZCR criterion for voiced speech detection

#### Scenario: Whisper speech ZCR
- **WHEN** the ZCR falls within the whisper range (0.10-0.40)
- **THEN** the sample passes the ZCR criterion for whisper speech detection

#### Scenario: Transient ZCR
- **WHEN** the ZCR exceeds 0.40 (characteristic of clicks and impulsive sounds)
- **THEN** the sample is flagged for transient rejection evaluation

### Requirement: Spectral Centroid Estimation
The system SHALL estimate the spectral centroid of audio samples using a computationally efficient approximation to identify speech-band frequency content without requiring FFT.

#### Scenario: Centroid calculation
- **WHEN** an audio buffer is processed
- **THEN** the system calculates an approximate spectral centroid in Hz using the first-difference method

#### Scenario: Voiced speech centroid
- **WHEN** the spectral centroid falls within the voiced speech band (250-4000 Hz)
- **THEN** the sample passes the spectral criterion for voiced speech detection

#### Scenario: Whisper speech centroid
- **WHEN** the spectral centroid falls within the whisper band (400-6000 Hz)
- **THEN** the sample passes the spectral criterion for whisper speech detection

#### Scenario: Transient centroid
- **WHEN** the spectral centroid exceeds 5500 Hz combined with high ZCR
- **THEN** the sample is classified as a transient and rejected

### Requirement: Transient Sound Rejection
The system SHALL explicitly reject impulsive transient sounds such as keyboard clicks, mouse clicks, and similar brief noises that could otherwise trigger false speech detection.

#### Scenario: Transient detection
- **WHEN** audio has both ZCR > 0.40 AND spectral centroid > 5500 Hz
- **THEN** the audio is classified as a transient regardless of amplitude

#### Scenario: Transient resets onset
- **WHEN** a transient is detected during speech onset accumulation
- **THEN** the onset timer is reset and no speech event is emitted

#### Scenario: Transient during speech
- **WHEN** a brief transient occurs during confirmed speech (within hold time)
- **THEN** the transient does not end the speech session prematurely

### Requirement: Whisper Detection Mode
The system SHALL include a dedicated whisper detection mode with parameters tuned for soft, breathy speech that has different acoustic characteristics than voiced speech.

#### Scenario: Whisper mode activation
- **WHEN** audio amplitude is between -50dB and -40dB with whisper-range features
- **THEN** the whisper detection mode evaluates the audio

#### Scenario: Whisper onset time
- **WHEN** whisper-mode audio is detected
- **THEN** a longer onset time (150ms vs 100ms) is required to confirm speech, filtering brief noises

#### Scenario: Whisper to voiced transition
- **WHEN** the user transitions from whispering to normal speech
- **THEN** the speech session continues without interruption
